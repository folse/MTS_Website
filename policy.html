</ol>


<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, local shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), and similar technology in connection with your use of the Site and third party websites ("Cookies"). Cookies are small data files that may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Site, such as your browser type, search preferences, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.</p>

<p>Types of Cookies used on the Site include:</p>

<p>Managing Cookies:</p>

<p>It may be possible to disable some (but not all) Cookies through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect your ability to use the Site. The method for disabling cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security settings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Third Parties</li>
</ol>


<p>We may share information about you with third parties as follows:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><pre><code>Advertisers: We may allow third parties to use Cookies on the Site to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as Touch Sweden does for itself. They may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt-out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative, Omniture, Aperture, Digital Advertising Alliance and PrivacyChoice. Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of advertisements to you.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Service Providers: Some of the services that are offered through the Site, such as dinner reservations and food delivery, may be provided by third-party providers. We also outsource some of Touch Sweden’s functions to third-party providers, such as technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing functions, and other services. We may share information from or about you with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Aggregate Information: We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Business Transfers: We may share information from or about you with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires Motion Touch Scandinavia AB or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Businesses on Touch Sweden: We may share information from or about you (such as your age and gender) and your use of the Site (such as which businesses you bookmark or call) with businesses on Touch Sweden. You may adjust your settings to increase or decrease the amount of information we share.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code> Investigations: We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure is (a) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us; (b) helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site; or (c) protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Links: The Site may contain links to unaffiliated third party websites. Except as set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on all such third party websites.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Facebook and Twitter: If you are logged into Facebook, and you access but are not logged into the Site, we may receive information from Facebook to make it easier for you to create an account on the Site and show you relevant content from your Facebook friends. This information personalizes your experience and helps you create a Touch Sweden account. To learn more about this feature and how to block aspects of it, please click here. You can also connect your Touch Sweden account to your accounts on third party services like Facebook or Twitter, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third party service. We use the information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers.

<li><p>Controlling Your Personal Data</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Business owners may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account if you include personal information in the content you send to them. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Site pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Site. Users can also use the Member Search feature to find businesses based on their names or email addresses.</p>

<p>Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Site are only private to the extent that both you and the sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your messages publicly posts it or its contents. Similarly, Touch Sweden may also access such messages in the course of investigations relating to Site use.</p>

<ol>
<li>Data Retention and Account Termination</li>
</ol>


<p>You can close your account by contacting us. We will remove your posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations. Please note that businesses cannot remove their business listings by closing their accounts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Children</li>
</ol>


<p>The Site is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>

<ol>
<li>Security</li>
</ol>


<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

</ol>


<p>The information we obtain from or about you may be processed and stored in Sweden, which may provide for different data protection rules than the country in which you reside.
